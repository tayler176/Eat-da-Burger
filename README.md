# Eat-da-Burger

Eat da Burger is app that uses MySQL, Express, ExpressHandleBars, Method-Override, and JawsDB. This application holds a list of three burgers to start. I ended up having to use Node Method-Override, because of a POST error when adding a new burger. This resolved the problem once it was install and a the middleware used.

The live link to the app is https://shrouded-ridge-94792.herokuapp.com/
